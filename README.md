## What is this?

This is my personal public wiki filled with content I'm interested in. Mostly somehow related to technology.

_Norwegian content is marked with:_ ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ 

## How to use

Use the navigation menu to the left to browse topics or the buttons in the bottom to go to the next/previous page. You can also search the content at top right.

## Found something wrong

Great, I would really appreciate if you added the issue [here](https://github.com/bakke92/hwiki/issues) so I can fix it.

## This isn't what I was looking for

Thanks for giving it a try, check out [bakke.be](https://bakke.be) for other content from me. 

If you want to look at cool content from others do I recommend my [starred repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/bakke92?tab=stars).
