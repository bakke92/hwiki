## What is this?

This is my public wiki filled with content I'm interested in. Mostly somehow related to technology.

## How to use

Use the navigation menu to the left to browse topics or the buttons in the bottom to go to the next/previous page. You can also search the content at top right.

Norwegian content is marked with: ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ 

## Found something wrong

Great, I would really appreciate if you added the issue [here](https://github.com/bakke92/hwiki/issues) so I can fix it.
