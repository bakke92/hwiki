## What is this?

This is my personal wiki. Available for everyone to read.

### What can be found here?

This wiki is filled with content I'm interested in. Mostly somehow related to technology.

### How to use:

Use the navigation menu to the left to browse topics or the magnifying glass at top right to search.

### Found something wrong:

Great, I would really appreciate if you added the issue [here](https://github.com/bakke92/hwiki/issues) so I can fix it.

### This isnt what I was looking for:

Ok, check out [https://bakke.be](https://bakke.be) for other content from me.
