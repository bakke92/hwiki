# Start here

## What is this?

This is my personal wiki. Available for everyone to read.

### What can I find here?

This wiki is filled with content I'm interested in. Mostly somehow related to technology.

### How to use:

Use the navigation menu to the left to browse topics or the magnifying glass at top right to search.

### This isnt what I was looking for:

Ok, check out [https://bakke.be](https://bakke.be) for other content from me. If you want to have a look at content from others do I recommend my [starred repos on GitHub](https://github.com/bakke92?tab=stars).
